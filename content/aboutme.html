<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<h3>My name is Tuna. I have studied Communication Sciences in Hacettepe University. 
    Right now I am also studying Computer Programming in Anadolu University.
    In the past, I had some small amount of experiences on programming but never
    continued until 2024 March. I started my journey on using computer for something different
    than gaming. Firstly I started with Cybersecurity on Udemy. Than after I learned 
    the basics of Cybersecurity, I learned beginner level in Python, intermediate level including Object Orianted Programming in C#, 
    intermediate level in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, SQL, React. I also have
    B2-C1 level English thanks to the movies, songs, TV series and my online friends whom I talked with
    almost everyday since 2017. What I am interested in is that I am being able to do my
    own stuffs like creating my own website, creating a loved-by-crowd game on mobile
    devices and PC with my close friends. Being successful is my absolute goal.
